                        <p>Excellent coaching was started in the year 1996 as a special coaching center to help aspiring students of Class LKG to 10 + 2. Building on the success of the coaching center, we expanded our services to providing formal school education to the children of Vijayapur district. With the sole aim of providing quality education to the deserving children of the region at a reasonable cost, we decided to do our best to build the necessary infrastructure to accommodate the maximum number of students without compromising on the quality of education imparted. Our years of hard work and commitment to building a standard Academy lead to the creation of one of the leading educational institutions in north Karnataka region, Excellent High School.</p>
