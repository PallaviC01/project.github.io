                        <h2>Women Safety Tracking System</h2>
                        <p>Womens safety is a very important issue due to rising crimes against women these days. To
                            help resolve this issue we propose a gps based womens safety system that has dual security
                            feature. It is useful because once an incident occurs with a woman she may or may not get
                            the chance to press the emergency button. In a button press alerting system, in case a woman
                            is hit on the head from behind, she may never get the chance to press panic button and no
                            one will know she is in trouble.

                        <h2>Attendence and Marks Management System.</h2>
                        <p>The attendance management system is a tool that keeps track of employee and student
                            attendance in institutes. It gives complete data about the time the students are present in
                            the institute and the time they take off. This process can be conducted by recording student
                            and employee hours using online attendance software for your company.</p>

                        <p>An attendance management system is used by an organization to track staff's time and
                            attendance details. You can save time and effort by calculating your employee's working
                            hours with an accurate attendance management system.</p>

                        <h2>Aniamal Health and Safety Monitoring System.</h2>
                        <p> According to Animal Health Monitoring System Survey, “Overall, the largest percentages of
                            deaths for equines more than 30 years of age [and used in the survey], were attributed to
                            old age (29.5%) followed by colic (17.5%) and injury/wounds/trauma which accounted for
                            10.5%.” Those with leg or hoof problems accounted for 7.1 percent of deaths. Neurologic
                            problems such as equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, wobbler's syndrome, spinal problems,
                            and seizures, accounted for 4 percent of the deaths of horses 20 years or older and 3.4
                            percent of all of the horses in the survey. More than 11 percent of the old horses (20 years
                            or older) were euthanized during the 1-year survey period.</p>
                        <p>Zigbee-based animal health monitoring system has sensor, processor and ZigBee module. It
                            generally used four different types of sensors such as rumination sensor, heart rate sensor,
                            temperature sensor and humidity sensor.</p>
